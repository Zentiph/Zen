# The Zen Programming Language
Zen is a statically-typed, compiled programming language developed from scratch as a personal learning project. It aims to blend the type safety and structure of Java with the simplicity and developer-friendly nature of Python, making for a truly zen-like coding experience.

## Example
Here is a demo program performing the FizzBuzz algorithm (may be subject to change as the language evolves):
```
// fizzbuzz.zen

fn fizzbuzz(int start, int end) {
    int num = start
    while (num < end) {
        string str = ""
        if (num % 3 == 0) {
            str += "Fizz"
        }
        if (num % 4 == 0) {
            str += "Buzz"
        }
        if (num % 4 != 0 and num % 3 != 0) {
            str += num
        }
        print(str)
    }
}

fizzbuzz(0, 20)
```
